## 💼 About Me  
🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Computing at MCAST (2023–2026).  
📖 I’m working on my **undergraduate dissertation in Software Engineering**, researching how **AI can evaluate and predict cognitive load in web design** to provide personalised accessibility feedback aligned with **WCAG** and the **European Accessibility Act (EAA)**.  
🚀 I aspire to specialise in **software engineering**, with a focus on intelligent systems, accessibility-first design, and scalable web applications.  
💡 I love working on projects that merge design, technology, and accessibility — especially when they have a real-world impact.
